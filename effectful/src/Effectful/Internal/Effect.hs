-- 'Effectful.Monad.Eff' operation over an arbitrary list of effects, so long as
-- @e@ is /somewhere/ in the list.
--
-- For example, an operation that only needs access to a cell of mutable state
-- containing an 'Integer' would likely use the following type:
--
-- @
-- 'Effectful.State.State' 'Integer' ':>' es => 'Effectful.Monad.Eff' es ()

  -- /Note:/ GHC is kind enough to cache these values as they're top level CAFs,
  -- so the lookup is amortized @O(1)@ without any language level tricks.
