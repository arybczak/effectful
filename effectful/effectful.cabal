synopsis:           An easy to use, performant extensible effects library.

description: An easy to use, performant extensible effects library with seamless
             integration with the existing Haskell ecosystem. See the main
             module "Effectful" for the documentation.
             .
             This is the "batteries-included" variant with many dependencies;
             See the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effectful-core
             effectful-core>@ package and other @effectful-*@ packages if you
             need a more limited dependency footprint.
