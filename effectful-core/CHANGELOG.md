# effectful-core-2.2.0.0 (2022-??-??)
* Change `PrimState` for `Eff` from `RealWorld` to `PrimStateEff` to prevent the
  `Prim` effect from executing arbitrary `IO` actions via `ioToPrim`.
* Deprecate `(:>>)` as [GHC can't efficiently deal with recursive type
  families](https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/19238).
* Add support for the `Alternative` and `MonadPlus` instances for `Eff` via the
  `NonDet` effect.

# effectful-core-2.1.0.0 (2022-08-22)
* Include the `e :> localEs` constraint in the `EffectHandler` to allow more
  flexibility in handling higher order effects.
* Do not include internal stack frames in `throwError` from
  `Effectful.Error.Dynamic`.

# effectful-core-2.0.0.0 (2022-08-12)
* Make storage references in the environment immutable.
* Remove `checkSizeEnv` and `forkEnv` from
  `Effectful.Dispatch.Static.Primitive`.
* Add internal versioning of effects to prevent leakage of `unsafeCoerce`.
* Make `interpose` and `impose` properly interact with other handlers.

# effectful-core-1.2.0.0 (2022-07-28)
* Change `SuffixOf` to `SharedSuffix` and make it behave as advertised.
* Add `raiseWith`.

# effectful-core-1.1.0.0 (2022-07-19)
* Don't reset the `UnliftStrategy` to `SeqUnlift` inside the continuation of
  `withEffToIO`.
* Add `withReader`.

# effectful-core-1.0.0.0 (2022-07-13)
* Initial release.
