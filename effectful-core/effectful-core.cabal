synopsis:           An easy to use, performant extensible effects library.

description: An easy to use, performant extensible effects library with seamless
             integration with the existing Haskell ecosystem.
             .
             This library provides core definitions with a minimal dependency
             footprint. See the @<https://hackage.haskell.org/package/effectful effectful>@
             package for documentation and the "batteries-included" variant.
